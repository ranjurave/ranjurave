#### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
## I am Ranju Raveendran. 
### I am a Game Developer & Fullstack Web Developer.

I have been working in 3D animation and my exposure to scripting in animation software got me interested in coding and software development. This inspired me to move to game development and learn more about software development.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on game engines like Unreal Engine and Unity. I am also learning Fullstack development.
